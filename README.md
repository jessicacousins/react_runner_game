## Description

Vite + React endless runner game with canvas-based gameplay and localStorage persistence, built for desktop and mobile browsers. Players choose one of three fish characters with distinct perks, select a tide difficulty, and optionally enable Safe Reef mode. Movement is controlled via arrow keys or tapping the top/bottom of the game area on touch devices. Glowing bubbles increase score with streak-based combo multipliers, while jellyfish and sharks apply character- and mode-dependent penalties. Per-run missions, a daily tide bonus, long-run milestones, and session summaries are tracked locally. Focus mode overlay
