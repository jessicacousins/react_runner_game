# Runner Game - Vite React

## Description

Vite React JavaScript project that runs in the browser as a local-storage runner game. Players choose from three fish characters, then use the arrow keys to swim up and down through the underwater lane. Collecting glowing bubbles adds 1 point, colliding with jellyfish or sharks acts as a hazard and subtracts 5 points from the current score.
