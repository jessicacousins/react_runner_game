## Description

Vite + React endless runner game with canvas-based gameplay and localStorage persistence, built for desktop and mobile browsers. Players choose one of three fish characters with distinct perks, select a tide difficulty, and optionally enable Safe Reef mode. Movement is controlled via arrow keys or tapping the top/bottom of the game area on touch devices. Glowing bubbles increase score with streak-based combo multipliers, while jellyfish and sharks apply character- and mode-dependent penalties. Per-run missions, a daily tide bonus, long-run milestones, and session summaries are tracked locally. Focus mode overlay for both mobile and desktop. On desktop, players can toggle fullscreen to fill the browser with the game and hide the surrounding UI. Original AI-generated music composed specifically for the game.
